Welcome to CMake Python Distributions's documentation!
======================================================

`CMake <http://www.cmake.org>`_ is used to control the software compilation
process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files,
and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the
compiler environment of your choice.

The suite of CMake tools were created by Kitware in response to the need
for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for open-source projects
such as `ITK <https://www.itk.org>`_ and `VTK <http://www.vtk.org>`_.

The CMake python wheels provide `CMake 3.28.0 <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.28/index.html>`_.
